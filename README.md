# Elmufactoria

A puzzle game where you guide robots from one end of the factory to the other, but only if they're following the rules!

## How to Play

### [â‡’ Play it here](https://mintchkin.github.io/elmufactoria)

Robots enter from the top center and exit from the bottom center. Each robot is carrying a sequence of colored balls that will determine whether they should be allowed to reach the exit, based on the level's rules.

Robots will only ever enter carrying the colors Blue and Red, but Yellow and Green are available for implementing more complicated logic.

Tiles may be rotated with WASD or inverted with the space bar before being placed on the grid, and you can test out a solution at any time with button under the grid.
